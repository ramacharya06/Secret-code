# Secret Code Generator

This is a Python program that creates a secret code language based on specific rules.

## Description

The "secret code" project aims to create a fun and unique language transformation system using Python. The rules for generating the secret code language are as follows:

1. **Rule 1**: If a word has more than 3 letters, append the first letter to the last. Additionally, there's a bonus rule to reverse the word.
   
2. **Rule 2**: Add random 3 letters in front and at the end of the word.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/secret-code.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
    ```bash
    cd secret-code
    ```

3. Run the program.
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input a word and generate its secret code.
